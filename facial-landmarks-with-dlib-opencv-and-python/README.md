# Real-time eye blink detection using facial landmarks

## The Objectives of a project

Using a webcam, we will get real-time video. so, I will detect and count eye blink with real-time video. 

#### &lt;result&gt;

![execution result gif. when i blink eyes, count up .](../.gitbook/assets/img_0359.gif)

### Knowledge to be used

1. We use a research result how changes in the ratio of the eyes when they blink. 
2. we need to use Opencv for detecting facial landmarks
3. we need to install dlib, imutils, .... packages to activity

### The Order of study...

1. what is dlib, imutils? \(+how to install\)
2. Real\_time facial-landmarks-dlib-opencv-python
3. introduce how to detect eye blink by "real-time eye blink detection using facial landmarks"
4. eye-blink-detection-opencv-dlib
